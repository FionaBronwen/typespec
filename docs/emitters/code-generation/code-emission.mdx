# Code emission from TypeSpec: user guide

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of emitting both server and client code from your TypeSpec API specifications, empowering you to adopt an API-First development approach. By defining your API contract upfront, you can efficiently scaffold and develop your backend and frontend services, ensuring consistency and alignment across your entire application stack.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, please refer to our [installation guide](https://typespec.io/docs/) for the latest setup instructions and requirements.

## Workflow options

You can use the Server Stub Emission feature from TypeSpec in two ways:

1.  **Command-line interface (CLI):** Ideal for automated builds and developers comfortable with the command line.
2.  **Visual studio code (VSCode) IDE with the TypeSpec extension:** Provides a seamless, integrated development experience within VSCode, including features like Intellisense and auto-completion to enhance productivity.

## Configuring `tspconfig.yaml` for client and server code emission

The `tspconfig.yaml` file is the heart of your TypeSpec project. It defines how your TypeSpec code is compiled and what outputs are emitted. To enable both client and server code emission, you need to configure the `emit` and `options` sections of this file.

Here's an example `tspconfig.yaml` file that enables client and server code emission for both C# (ASP.NET Core) and JavaScript (Node.js/Express):

```yaml
emit:
  - "@typespec/openapi3"
  - "@typespec/http-client-csharp"
  - "@typespec/http-client-js"
  - "@typespec/http-server-js"
  - "@typespec/http-server-csharp"
options:
  "@typespec/openapi3":
    emitter-output-dir: "{project-root}/openapi/"
  "@typespec/http-client-csharp":
    emitter-output-dir: "{project-root}/clients/csharp"
  "@typespec/http-client-js":
    emitter-output-dir: "{project-root}/clients/javascript"
  "@typespec/http-server-csharp":
    emitter-output-dir: "{project-root}/servers/aspnet/emitted"
  "@typespec/http-server-js":
    emitter-output-dir: "{project-root}/servers/javascript"
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`emit` section:** This section lists the *emitters* that you want to use. An emitter is a plugin that takes your TypeSpec code and *emits* output in a specific format (e.g., OpenAPI, C# client, JavaScript server).

    *   `"@typespec/openapi3"`: Emits an OpenAPI 3.0 specification. This is primarily used for legacy workflows and is not strictly required for client or server code emission.
    *   `"@typespec/http-client-csharp"`: Emits a C# client library.
    *   `"@typespec/http-client-js"`: Emits a JavaScript client library.
    *   `"@typespec/http-server-csharp"`: Emits a C# (ASP.NET Core) server stub.
    *   `"@typespec/http-server-js"`: Emits a JavaScript (Node.js/Express) server stub.
*   **`options` section:** This section configures the emitters. For each emitter, you can specify options like the output directory.
    *   `emitter-output-dir`: This option specifies where the emitted code should be placed. The `{project-root}` variable refers to the root directory of your TypeSpec project.

**Important:** Make sure you have installed all the necessary emitters:
```bash
npm install -D @typespec/openapi3 @typespec/http-client-csharp @typespec/http-client-js @typespec/http-server-csharp @typespec/http-server-js
```

## Using the CLI to emit client and server code

1.  **Create a TypeSpec project:** If you don't already have one, create a new TypeSpec project using `tsp init`.

    ```bash
    mkdir my-api
    cd my-api
    tsp init
    ```

    During `tsp init`, you will be prompted to select different emitters, including server and client. If you have the necessary dependencies installed, TypeSpec can automatically populate your `tspconfig.yaml` file.

2.  **Define your api:** Write your API specification in a `.tsp` file (e.g., `main.tsp`). This is where you define your models, operations, and routes.

3.  **Compile your TypeSpec:** Use the `tsp compile` command to emit both client and server code, as well as other artifacts based on your specification.

    ```bash
    tsp compile .
    ```

    The compiler will output the emitted client and server code to the directories specified in your `tspconfig.yaml` file (e.g., `clients/csharp` for C# client libraries and `servers/aspnet/emitted` for C# server stubs).

4.  **Project structure:** After compiling, you will typically see the following structure:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<FileTree>
    my-api/
    ├── tsp-output/
    │   ├── schema/                  # Emitted OpenAPI 3.0 spec
    │   │   └── openapi.yaml
    │   ├── clients/                 # Emitted Client libraries for selected language(s)
    │   │   ├── dotnet/
    │   │   └── node/
    │   └── servers/                 # Emitted Server Code
    │       ├── aspnet/
    │       │   └── emitted/         # Emitted code for ASP.NET
    │       └── node/
    │           └── emitted/         # Emitted code for Node.js
    ├── main.tsp
    ├── tspconfig.yaml
    └── package.json
</FileTree>

## Understanding the emitted code structure

The server stub emission process creates a basic code structure for your server application. The specific files and folders emitted depend on the target language and the complexity of your API.

**C# (ASP.NET core) example:**

Based on a generic 'todo' style app, the emitted code structure for C# will typically include:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<FileTree>
servers/
┣ aspnet/
┃ ┗ emitted/
┃   ┣ controllers/               # Contains the base controller classes
┃ ┃ ┃ ┣ CommentOpsOperationsControllerBase.cs  # Base class for comment-related API operations
┃ ┃ ┃ ┣ CommentsOperationsControllerBase.cs   # Base class for general comment operations
┃ ┃ ┃ ┣ ... (other controller base classes)
┃   ┣ lib/                     # Utility functions
┃ ┃ ┃ ┣ ArrayConstraintAttribute.cs    # Custom attributes for enforcing array constraints
┃ ┃ ┃ ┣ Base64UrlConverter.cs        # Utility for Base64 URL encoding
┃ ┃ ┃ ┣ ... (other utility files)
┃   ┣ models/                  # Defines the data models (DTOs) used by the API
┃ ┃ ┃ ┣ Attachment.cs              # Data model representing an attachment
┃ ┃ ┃ ┣ Collaborator.cs            # Data model representing a collaborator
┃ ┃ ┃ ┣ ... (other model files)
┃   ┗ operations/              # Defines service interface
┃ ┃ ┃ ┣ ICommentOpsOperations.cs  # Service interface for comment-related operations
┃ ┃ ┃ ┣ ICommentsOperations.cs   # Service interface for general comment operations
┃ ┃ ┃ ┣ ... (other operation interface files)
</FileTree>

*   **`lib`**: This directory contains utility classes such as custom attributes used for server side validation to ensure input data adhere to the spec.

*   **`Models`**: These files define the data models (also known as Data Transfer Objects or DTOs) used in your API (e.g., `TodoItem.cs`, `Project.cs`). These classes represent the structure of the data being exchanged between the client and the server.

*   **`Operations`**: These files define the service interface used for API operations.

**Node.js/express example:**

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<FileTree>
node/
┗ tsp-output/
  ┗ @typespec/
┃   ┗ http-server-javascript/
┃ ┃   ┣ helpers/         # Contains helper functions
┃ ┃ ┃ ┃ ┣ header.ts    # Helper for header operations
┃ ┃ ┃ ┃ ┣ multipart.ts # Helper for multipart form data
┃ ┃ ┃ ┃ ┗ router.ts    # Helper for routing
┃ ┃   ┣ http/           # Contains http request related code
┃ ┃ ┃ ┃ ┗ router.ts    # Helper for setting up http router
┃ ┃   ┗ models/         # Contains emitted data models
┃ ┃ ┃   ┣ all/         # Contains helper import all the data models
┃ ┃ ┃ ┃ ┃ ┗ getitdone/  # Folder containing data models emitted from getitdone namespace
┃ ┃ ┃ ┃ ┃   ┗ index.ts   # Helper to export the data models
┃ ┃ ┃   ┗ synthetic.ts # Type spec synthetic code
</FileTree>

*   **`Helpers`**: This folder contains helper functions to perform common operations such as setting header, and multipart operations.

*   **`Http`**: This folder contains code for setting up the http requests.

*   **`Models`**: This folder contains code and helper functions for all data models.

## Using the VSCode extension

The TypeSpec Extension for VSCode offers a convenient way to emit both client and server code directly from your IDE.

1.  **Install the extension:** Search for "TypeSpec" in the VSCode Extensions Marketplace and install the official TypeSpec extension.

2.  **Create a TypeSpec project:**
    *   Click “Create TypeSpec Project” in the EXPLORE sidebar.
    *   Select a project root folder.
    *   Provide the required inputs via Quick Picks, similar to using `tsp init` on the command line.

3.  **Define your api:** Write your API specification in a `.tsp` file.

4.  **Emit the client and server code:**
    *   Right-click on a `.tsp` file to open the context menu.
    *   Select “Emit from TypeSpec”.
    *   Select "Client and Server Code" from the Emitter Types.
    *   Choose the desired target language (e.g., ".NET – Emit .Net server stub by @typespec/http-server-csharp").
    *   TypeSpec compiler will run in the background, emitting a new directory under "servers\<language>".

## Next steps

*   **Add business logic:** Implement the core logic for your API endpoints within the emitted server stub. **Remember that the emitted controllers are base classes; you will need to create concrete classes that inherit from them and implement your business logic.**
*   **Configure routes:** Verify and configure the routes defined in your server project. You may need to adjust the routing configuration to match your TypeSpec definitions.
*   **Add data persistence:** Integrate your server with a database or other data storage solution.
*   **Implement authentication and authorization:** Secure your API by adding appropriate authentication and authorization mechanisms.
